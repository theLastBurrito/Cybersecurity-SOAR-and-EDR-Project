# Project Objective
This project showcases the integration of Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) with Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) to automate security workflows and enhance cybersecurity posture. Using LimaCharlie for EDR and Tines for SOAR, the project provides real-time security insights and automated responses, focusing on detecting and mitigating credential access attacks with the LaZagne tool.

LimaCharlie detects the use of LaZagne on endpoint devices, triggering automated alerts and remediation actions, with the option for users to decide whether to isolate affected machines. Communication is streamlined through Slack and email, ensuring timely alerts and responses, making security operations more dynamic and adaptable.

# Tools Used
- <b>Windows Machine</b>: Target machine LimaCharlie will detect for isolation decision, where users can choose to isolate it based on the threat severity.
- <b>LimaCharlie (EDR)</b>: Used to detect and respond to security threats.
- <b>Tines (SOAR)</b>: Automates the security workflows and orchestrates the response actions.
- <b>Slack</b>: Serves as the communication platform to receive alert detections.
- <b>Gmail (Email)</b>: Used to receive detection alert emails.
- <b>VMware</b>: the virtual machine used in the project.

# Skills Gained 
- Integration of SOAR and EDR Tools: Developed the ability to integrate SOAR tools with EDR platforms, enhancing automated incident response capabilities.
- Automation of Security Workflows: Learned to design and implement automated security workflows, enabling real-time detection, response, and notification processes that streamline incident handling.
- Threat Detection and Response: Gained experience in configuring and using LimaCharlie to detect threats on compromised endpoints, including decision-making on whether to isolate affected machines based on detected threats.
- Communication and Alerting Systems: Enhanced skills in setting up and managing communication and alerting systems using Slack and email, ensuring timely and effective dissemination of critical security information.
- User Prompt Configuration: Acquired the ability to create and configure user prompts within the SOAR workflow, allowing for interactive decision-making during the incident response process.
- Incident Response Management: Improved overall incident response management skills, including the ability to coordinate responses across multiple tools and platforms, ensuring a cohesive and efficient approach to handling security incidents.

# Step
Navigate to [LimaCharlie](https://limacharlie.io/) and create an account.

<b> - Next, i will download LaZagne (Password Recovery Tool) on the Windows Server to generate telemetry in LimaCharlie </b>

Click on the [LaZagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne)
#### <b> *note: Disable Real-time protection under Windows Security for LaZagne.exe to download successfully.* </b>

From the downloads folder, hold shift and right-click on <b>LaZagne</b> and <b>Open Powershell window here</b>.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cef7b445-21ea-4c0c-85fa-088ef4815458" width="500" />
